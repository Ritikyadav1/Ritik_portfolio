        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>Web development involves the creation and maintenance of websites
          and web applications, focusing on both front-end and back-end
          development. It requires proficiency in various programming languages,
          frameworks, and tools to deliver responsive, interactive, and user-friendly
          digital experiences. A web developer's skill set typically includes expertise
          in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for structuring, styling, and adding functionality
          to web pages, along with knowledge of frameworks like React or Angular.
          On the back-end, developers work with server-side technologies such as
          Node.js, databases like SQL and MongoDB, and APIs to ensure smooth data flow
          and application performance. Additionally, web developers are skilled in version control,
          responsive design, and optimizing web applications for performance, accessibility, and SEO.</p>

        <h3>Data Analysis </h3>
        <p>Data analysis involves creating robust, scalable, and high-performance processes for inspecting, cleansing,
          transforming, and modeling data. As one of the most critical practices in various industries, it enables
          analysts to derive meaningful insights from both structured and unstructured data sources. This process helps
          in building everything from predictive models and dashboards to comprehensive reports and large-scale
          data-driven strategies. By leveraging data analysis, organizations can optimize operations, enhance
          decision-making, and drive innovation across different sectors.</p>
